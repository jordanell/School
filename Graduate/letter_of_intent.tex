\opening{To whom it concerns,} 
 
This letter will state my intent for graduate studies in Computer Science at the University of Victoria. My field of interest concerns the ideas of social and technical dimensions of work in large software applications and their effects on code quality.

 Social and technical dimensions of work relates to the technical dependencies of a software project when paired with social dependencies and actions. 
I plan on investigating the effects of this congruence on code quality. Specifically I hope to show
that this congruence when neglected causes malfunctions inside of the software product. Secondly, using this congruence, I hope to build an application based off of social recommendations which will prevent these type of software
malfunctions from taking place.
 
My interest is this topic has come about through my previous work with Dr. Daniela Damian. I have worked on several projects with her before in this field and wish to continue my work and start new challenges with her at the University 
of Victoria.

\closing{Sincerely yours,}
