To compile this program, navigate to /bin of the project and type "make BOX=dell". This will work on 
the machines in Lab ECS242.

To run this program with an input file type "./canvas tri1.input" where tri1.input is the name of your
input file. make sure you are also inside the folder to which you compiled the code to.

Problem: Integer Interpolation

Description: The integer interpolation problem is simply being able to interpolate all points of a given
line while only using integers and addition (and subtraction) only. The normal approach to interpolation
is to use floating point values to easily calculate the need values and then rounding to integers to be
plotted on a line. So this extra requirement adds some form of complexity to the assignment.

Solution: The solution to this problem is to use Bresenham's Algorithm which provides an instance
of integer only linear interpolation.

Methodology: The way Bresenham's Algorithm works is to find the change in x and the change in y required
for each small step of the line. Now each time you move to the next step of the line you can add dx and dy
to running totals and this way you can keep track of when you need to move y up or down a integer and the 
same with x. This way you avoid floating point values.

Modified Code: The code that was changed was all in lowlevel.c I change the inner two for loops inside of
both drawLeftTriangle and drawRightTriangle so that they call interpolate on the edges so that the end
values are set for a horizontal line. I added drawRowByVertex which takes two vertices as end points so
that the color can be stored. It also calls interpolate on all points in the line. I added 
interpolateColorInt function as a starting point of Bresenham's Algorithm and added bresenhamAlgorithm 
as the rest of the algorithm function. I added interpolateColor for interpolating with floating point
values. I also added printColor and printVertex as debugging functions. I have also added a function called
interpolateChannelInt which interpolates only one channel of a color, aka one line.

Additional Marks: I believe I have completed the following tasks outile in the grading rubric:
